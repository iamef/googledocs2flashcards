[a]not all goods and services are produced by the corporate sector in the United States.There is also a large and robust noncorporate sector consisting of self-employed individuals, partnerships, and other organizational forms that do not seek the protections of incorporation.The noncorporate sector accounts for about one-quarter of sales in the United States.
[b]Within the corporate sector, most of the production is by firms owned by a large number of shareholders, individuals who have purchased ownership stakes in a company.The major advantage of incorporation is that it offers the guarantee of limited liability, which means that the owners of a firm cannot be held personally responsible for the obligations of the firm. If a corporation fails, the shareholders are not required by law to use their personal assets (such as their homes and jewelry) to pay the debts of the failed company.The most that shareholders can lose is the amount they have invested in the corporation.
[c]individuals who have purchased ownership stakes in a company.
[d]Income from an S-corporation is treated as personal income as it is earned and is subject to the individual income tax;income from C-corporations is subject to the corporate income tax as it is earned and may be subject to the individual income tax again as it is distributed to a corporation’s shareholders. Our discussion of corporate taxation will focus on C-corporations, which account for most of the production of the corporate sector.
[e]Generally, in a corporation
ownership - shareholders
control - managers, make day to day decisions on how to run the corporation
[f]A set of individuals who meet periodi-
cally to review decisions made by a firm’s management and report back to the broader set of owners on management’s performance.
[g]executives can buy stocks in their own company to encourage their company to do well
[h]making investments and getting rewards from them
[i]1) debt financing
- selling corporate bonds
- pay interest on them to the lenders / bondholders


2) equity financing
- selling share of ownership
- How are investors rewarded


3) retained earnings
[j]1) pure profits taxation is efficient because corporations are trying to maximize profits and therefore less distortionary than taxing the inputs (labor, capital)


2) retained earnings can prevent shareholders from earning $$
[k]RE: retained earnings


I'm going to show the policy problem by way of an example. Suppose you and I ran an insurance company that generates $1 billion in income every year from the insurance business. If corporate income weren't taxed, we could take the $1 billion in earnings and just invest it in the stock market and other assets — but not return it to our investors. As our company that slowly accumulates billion upon billion in assets, the company becomes increasingly valuable. As long as our investors invest for the long-term, their effective tax rate on capital income can be very low (even zero, if they hold our company until death). So the government would collect almost zero tax revenue on this income.


An efficiency problem with this (clearly, the above is inequitable) is that we want capital to be invested new profit-generating activities, instead of being stored in corporations that don't need it but hold onto it because it is tax-favored to hold onto it. By taxing earnings even when not returned to investors, we create an incentive against using corporations as, essentially, a gigantic tax-favored savings account.


https://piazza.com/class/keix8p6gyngi2?cid=182
[l]yes if it is economic, rather than accounting profits
[m]relatively progressive because those receiving the profits from production are likely to be well-off


Gruber estimates that it is 50-50


See 24.3 for more details
[n]taxes = ([revenues - expenses] * t) - tax credits
[o]1) cash flow of doing business
- compensation paid to employees
- inputs to production (steel, energy)
- rent on buildings


2) interest payments


3) depreciation
[p]When the company buys equipment or a new building, however, it is investing in a good that will deliver services for many years. Thus, the tax code does not permit the full costs of the machine to be deducted in the period of purchase. Instead, the tax code allows the corporation to deduct from its taxes depreciation allowances, which are tax allowances that are designed to approximate the rate at which the capital investment loses its value.
[q]deterioration of value


for example
- b/c it is obsolete and reevaluation as product improves AND (complementary) new software only works on new computers
- machines break down over time
[r]1) straight line depreciation
2) accelerated
3) expensing investments
[s]basically the cost of this is borne upfront instead of having depreciation schedules...
[t]A credit that allows firms to deduct a percentage of their annual qualified investment expenditures from the taxes they owe.
[u]consumers who buy products


workers who supply labor


capital supply
[v]A series of recent papers suggests that there is a large effect of corporate taxation on wages. For example, Desai et al. (2010) found that 45 to 75% of the corporate tax burden is shifted to wages, while Serrato and Zidar (2014) found that 35% is shifted to wages, 25% is shifted to land owners (through general equilibrium effects), and 40% is borne by corporate owners.
[w]short run: supply of capital is not very elastic (think of things like long)


long run: more elastic because investors can invest in non-corporate
[x]incidence
50% on the capitalists
50% on the workers
more progressive than income tax
less progressive than capital gains tax
[y]Capital (economics), a factor of production that is not wanted for itself but for its ability to help in producing other goods
[z]MC = rho+delta
rho is dividends payment per $ invested
delta is depreciation
[aa]depreciation
[ab]dividends to the investor because 


- the investor invests in the firm so that it could grow
- the firm needs to repay the investor


Suppose this firm finances its investment by selling equity shares in the firm. In return, it has to make dividend payments each period of rho per dollar borrowed.
[ac]Shifts the MPk curve down 
you now have (1-tau) * MPk


This is because you are only keeping 1-tau per dollar from your investment due to tax.
[ad]it also shifts down
MC is now (1-tau*z-alpha)*MC
z takes into account the PDV of depreciation
alpha is the investment tax credit


I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS
[ae]The conclusion of recent studies is that the investment decision is fairly sensitive to tax incentives, with an elasticity of investment with respect to the effective tax rate on the order of 20.5: as taxes lower the cost of investment by 10%, there is 5% more investment.This sizeable elasticity suggests that corporate tax policy can be a powerful tool in determining investment and that the corporate tax is very far from a pure profits tax.
[af]the effective MTR is by definition


[MPk(after tax) - MPk(before tax)] / (MPk(after tax))
[ag]YES!!
[ah]yes
[ai]no, which doesn't really make sense...
[aj]debt, 


because what is paid in interest in debt is deducted from tax


the profits made as a whole is taxed... and that includes dividends you pay to the stockholder
[ak]capital gains is more favorable


the effective capital gains tax is smaller
[al]agency problem
- the more a firm is debt financed, the more risk you take b/c screw the debt holders—the equity owners earn the firm


- this means that interest rate is higher for risky firm (financed mostly by debt and no so much from equity...)


- debt also you fail, you are screwed...
[am]remember control vs. owners


1) agency problem
the owners probably don't trust the managers (people in control) to have the money


2) signaling
I am doing great and got cash to burn :)
[an]According to the model that can't explain why dividends happen in the 1st place
1) decrease in dividends payments
2) increase in debt financing
3) could reduce corporate investments since the MC curve is higher


According to agency and signaling
- possibly increased investment?


Empirical evidence
- retained earning matters a lot (possibly the most) in terms of investment financing; less dividends -> more retained earnings
- little impact on investment
[ao]The removal of the corporate tax to tax corporate income at the individual (shareholder) level.


basically no corporate tax, only tax the shareholders
[ap]- remove tax favoritism
- less DWL from being in the wrong incorporation
[aq]- possibly reduce revenue for gov't since we aren't taxed twice...
- rich people benefit since investors tend to be rich people
[ar]our international competitors have lower tax rates
it is quite distortionary by reducing investment
[as]A tax system in which corporations earning income abroad pay tax only to the government of the country in which the income is earned.
[at]A tax system in which corporations are taxed by their home countries on their income regardless of where it is earned.


the US had a global system until Trump
[au]not really because of repatriation
- it is screwing us because the money is not being invested in America
[av]Not really
- the PDV gain of delaying tax payments on income earned in other nations
- the ability to shift profits from high- to low-tax nations.
[aw]u.S.-based multinational corporations may claim a credit against their u.S. taxes for any tax payments made to foreign governments when funds are repatriated to the parent.
[ax]the return of income from a foreign country to a corporation's home country
[ay]tax is only collected when it is returned to the U.S.
- deferring tax is beneficial because of PDV
- they could also never return the money to the US...
[az]they are "shit-hole" contries that don't have a lot of human capital


what is transfer pricing?
[ba]The amount that one subsidiary of a corporation reimburses another subsidiary of the same corporation for goods transferred between the two.


Where the corporation distributes its profits is up to the firm
[bb]in a territorial system, if you transfer price you never pay taxes. 


in a global system, you would pay if you repatriate. BUT also the U.S. had tax holidays (where you have a favorable tax)...
[bc]Is there a difference in taxes
[bd]- reducing distortions (tax wedges)
- raise revenue
[be]broader base, low taxes
[bf]increased tax compliance, simplifying tax code, increasing tax efficiency
[bg]tax evasion Illegal nonpayment of taxation.


tax avoidance: taking legal actions to shift income tp non-taxable forms (health insurance vs. wages)
[bh]MB is the tax rate


MC is upward sloping
- the likelihood of being caught increases
- larger marginal fines (possibly)
[bi]1) efficiency
if we have higher taxes to try to collect revenue lost from evasion, it's an efficiency loss
- cheating not [ositive externality
- more cheating with higher taxes


2) vertical equity
- it's easier for wealthy people to cheat (non-wage ways of cheating)


3) horizontal equity
- otherwise similar individuals pay diff taxes whether or not they cheat
[bj]If we remove 750 billion tax evasion / year


On auditing...
1977: 8% companies are audited, 1% companies are audited
We audit poor people more than we audit rich people for taxes?
[bk]Almost no evasion is done by regular people because wage income is pretty much taxed automatically


rich people can hide their taxes through many means...
[bl]- unnecessary costs for society tp take a long time to fill out taxes
- harder for tax evasion
[bm]not necessarily


including employer-provided health insurance in the tax base might complicate things since the employer has to tell the employee how much its worth
[bn]1) Gross Income effect (Laffer curve)
- this one seems to be least important...


2) Reporting effect (choosing health insurance vs. income to avoid taxes)


3) Income exclusion effect (you pay more to charity)


the above 3 are legal


4) compliance effect (RIP tax evasion...)
[bo]most of this response comes from the indirect effects of reporting,
income exclusion, and compliance and not from the indirect effect of gross income earning.
[bp]First, the indirect effects we listed do offset the direct effect of raising tax rates to a significant degree.While estimates vary, a central estimate is that there is roughly a 4% decline in the base of taxable income for each 10% rise in tax rates. This response implies a significant deadweight loss
[bq]most—if not all—of this response comes from the rich.This should not be surprising because lower- and middle-class taxpayers have relatively lit- tle scope to take advantage of the income reporting, exclusion, and compliance effects. In terms of the income reporting effect, lower- and middle-income families have relatively little control over the form of their compensation, so they can’t shift toward tax-favored forms of compensation. In terms of the income exclusion effect, given the income required for expenses of daily liv- ing, there is only a limited scope for lower- and middle-income families to shift expenditures toward charity or higher mortgage payments. In terms of the compliance effect, the taxes of middle-income taxpayers are largely col- lected by withholding the taxes from wage income as it is paid by employers, so that relatively little scope for evasion exists.
[br]it should decrease the elasticity since [eople have less places to hide their taxes
[bs]a concentraded, well-organized group of people
[bt]activities whose sole reason for existence is tax minimization.
[bu]for an asset which is a tax shelter, part of the value of the asset is due to the fact that is a tax shelter
[bv]changes in the treatment of similar individu- als who have made different decisions in the past and are therefore differentially treated by tax reform.
[bw]before tax reform
if you bought a house (that had a high price) because of mortgage tax deduction


tax reform: we will take away your mortgage tax deduction


after tax reform
- the house price decreases (if full capitalization, to the PDV of mortgage payments) 
- RIP person who bought house for a high price, can't do mortgage tax deduction, and sells house for a low price
[bx]++ Reduce political pressure against passing the tax reform


whereby those who made decisions under the old tax rules are allowed to continue to benefit from those rules, while the rules are changed for all future decisions


-- RIP Money lost due to grandfathering
[by]trying to avoid transitional inequities can add to making exceptions b/c RIP grandfathering
[bz]1) Improved capital allocation
- people may be distorted by differences in tax burdens


2) Fairer and more savings
- horizontal equity if you choose to save vs. consuming
- eliminates tax on savings and therefore anti-savings bias


3) more simple
[ca]1) vertical equity
- the richest people do the most savings


2) targeting
- the government wants to redistribute from high ability to the low ability
- high ability people tend to save more, so you should tax them


3) transition
- babies probably favor it since the economy is more efficient
- elderlies HATE it. they've been paying 


4) compliance
- black markets


5) cascading
- RIP intermediate goods
[cb]A consumption tax levied on each stage of a good’s production on the increase in value of
the good at that stage of production.
[cc]- the buyer and seller want to minimize their taxes
- your gain from cheating is smaller
[cd]A consump- tion tax levied on yearly con- sumption rather than on specific sales.
[ce]A tax on the difference between cash income and savings.
[cf]retirement saving, savings by owning a home is tax-favorable
[cg]it can be a way to calculate how people consume and therefore allow for a (progressive) expenditure tax
[ch]a pure cash-flow tax would allow more ways to deduct via savings
- but rich people save more
- this would also decrease your revenue
[ci]a version of flat tax


1) pay flat VAT on their sales (minus) wage payments


2) labor income tax only (no capital gains tax)
3) all exemptions (health insurance, charitable contributions, mortgage payments) eliminated, just have a single family deduction
[cj]1) efficiency
- larger tax base
- lower taxes
- no distortion for savings
- no distrotions from corporations and their investments


2) compliance
[ck]1) vertical equity
- less progressive for the high, high income group...


2) transitional inequities
RIP people who owned homes
RIP people with health insurance
[cl]not really...
