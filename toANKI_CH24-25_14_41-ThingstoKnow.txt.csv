* What are corporations? What is their role in the economy? [a][b]
","
[a]not all goods and services are produced by the corporate sector in the United States.There is also a large and robust noncorporate sector consisting of self-employed individuals, partnerships, and other organizational forms that do not seek the protections of incorporation.The noncorporate sector accounts for about one-quarter of sales in the United States.


[b]Within the corporate sector, most of the production is by firms owned by a large number of shareholders, individuals who have purchased ownership stakes in a company.The major advantage of incorporation is that it offers the guarantee of limited liability, which means that the owners of a firm cannot be held personally responsible for the obligations of the firm. If a corporation fails, the shareholders are not required by law to use their personal assets (such as their homes and jewelry) to pay the debts of the failed company.The most that shareholders can lose is the amount they have invested in the corporation.

* Why should we tax corporate income? [j][k]
","
[j]1) pure profits taxation is efficient because corporations are trying to maximize profits and therefore less distortionary than taxing the inputs (labor, capital)


2) retained earnings can prevent shareholders from earning $$


[k]RE: retained earnings


I'm going to show the policy problem by way of an example. Suppose you and I ran an insurance company that generates $1 billion in income every year from the insurance business. If corporate income weren't taxed, we could take the $1 billion in earnings and just invest it in the stock market and other assets — but not return it to our investors. As our company that slowly accumulates billion upon billion in assets, the company becomes increasingly valuable. As long as our investors invest for the long-term, their effective tax rate on capital income can be very low (even zero, if they hold our company until death). So the government would collect almost zero tax revenue on this income.


An efficiency problem with this (clearly, the above is inequitable) is that we want capital to be invested new profit-generating activities, instead of being stored in corporations that don't need it but hold onto it because it is tax-favored to hold onto it. By taxing earnings even when not returned to investors, we create an incentive against using corporations as, essentially, a gigantic tax-favored savings account.

[p]When the company buys equipment or a new building, however, it is investing in a good that will deliver services for many years. Thus, the tax code does not permit the full costs of the machine to be deducted in the period of purchase. Instead, the tax code allows the corporation to deduct from its taxes depreciation allowances, which are tax allowances that are designed to approximate the rate at which the capital investment loses its value.

[bo]most of this response comes from the indirect effects of reporting,
income exclusion, and compliance and not from the indirect effect of gross income earning.


[bp]First, the indirect effects we listed do offset the direct effect of raising tax rates to a significant degree.While estimates vary, a central estimate is that there is roughly a 4% decline in the base of taxable income for each 10% rise in tax rates. This response implies a significant deadweight loss


[bq]most—if not all—of this response comes from the rich.This should not be surprising because lower- and middle-class taxpayers have relatively lit- tle scope to take advantage of the income reporting, exclusion, and compliance effects. In terms of the income reporting effect, lower- and middle-income families have relatively little control over the form of their compensation, so they can’t shift toward tax-favored forms of compensation. In terms of the income exclusion effect, given the income required for expenses of daily liv- ing, there is only a limited scope for lower- and middle-income families to shift expenditures toward charity or higher mortgage payments. In terms of the compliance effect, the taxes of middle-income taxpayers are largely col- lected by withholding the taxes from wage income as it is paid by employers, so that relatively little scope for evasion exists.
